    // okay, here is another thing we can do
    // lets say we want to define a method on a type,
    // but we do not want all types built from the struct to implement all methods
    // we can conditionally allow methods to exist on a type by using trait bounds
    // here is an example

    // first we create a type called Pair
    struct Pair<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }

    // now we implement a method on pair which every one can use
    impl<T> Pair<T> {
        fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
            Self {x, y}
        }
    }

    // now we implement a method which has a restriction
    // these methods can be called only if the created type has implemented Display and PartialOrd
    impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
        fn cmp_display(&self) {
            if self.x >= self.y {
                println!("the largest member is x = {}" , self.x);
            } else {
                println!("the largest member is y = {}", self.y);
            }
        }
    }

    // okay, lets say we want to do something like this
    // say you have a trait called Display
    // and you want to say:
    // "for every type that implements Display, I also want to implement ToString"
    // this is called blanket implementation
    // for example, in the rust standard lib, every type which implements Display also implements ToString
    // this allows for easy method sharing amongst types

    // lifetimes ensure that a reference is valid as long as we need them to be
    // lifetimes exist to prevent dangling references

    // here is an example where we can use lifetimes
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";
    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("the longest string is {}", result);

    // if we implements the longest function as follows, we will get an error about lifetimes
    // we have no idea if x or y will be returned from the function
    // we also have no way of knowing the context in which this function will be called
    // so we must specify lifetimes
    // fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    //     if x.len() > y.len() {
    //         x
    //     } else {
    //         y
    //     }
    // }

    // lets rewrite the function using lifetimes
    // now the function will work!
    // this function now tells rust the the references pass into the function must live as long
    // as the values from which they were derived from
    // so if we do no adhere to this rule, the compiler will throw an error
    // these annocations create a constraint on the function
    // and gatekeep any values which might be passed ins
    fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
        if x.len() > y.len() {
            x
        } else {
            y
        }
    }

    // lets try to challenge the constraint by using a value whos lifetime does not last long enough
    let s1 = String::from("this is longer than the other");
    // let result;
    {
        let s2 = String::from("shorter");
        // here, s2 is borrowed, but it's lifetime ends at the end of this scope
        // result = longest(s1.as_str(), s2.as_str());
    }
    // we now try to print out the value of result, but s2 is now invalid
    // so the borrow checker will complain and let us know s2 dies before we try and use result
    // these constaints are derived from the lifetimes we specified in the longest function definition
    // println!("the longest string is {}", result);

    // we can also use reference in struct definitions, but to do so, we must speficy the lifetimes
    struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
        part: &'a str,
    }

    let novel = String::from("call me jon. some years ago...");
    // this returns a reference
    let first_sentance = novel.split('.').next().expect("could not find a .");
    // now we are attempting to use a reference in our type
    // so if we failed to specify the lifetime in the struct definition, this would fail
    // the lifetime helps to ensure first_sentance lives long enough to be used in this data type
    // the data type we create here, cannot out live first_sentance, as the type is dependant on it
    let it = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentance,
    };

    // basiaclly, any function, method, or struct which takes hold of a reference, must annotate the lifetimes of that reference
    // this tells the compiler to ensure that everything is in the proper scope and that all attemps to access a ref are valid

    // rust has some specific cases where lifetimes are not required
    // basically, rust has some rules typed in which identify patterns in written code
    // code where lifetimes are frequently used without any sort of risk have been identified
    // these types of cases now do not require lifetime checks
    // because they have been proven to not be a risk to memory management
    // less lifetimes will be required overtime as more of these cases are identified

    // THE THREE RULES OF LIFETIMES
    // rust has some rules where it tries to figure out the lifetimes of the parameters, and return types of functions
    // #1 = all params to functions get their own lifetime
    // #2 = if only 1 param is listed, all output will match the params lifetime
    // #3 = if one param is &self, then the lifetime of self is applied to all inputs and all outputs

    // the above rules are why we needed to specify the lifetimes in the longest function
    // we had two params, so rule number one gave them each their own lifetime
    // rule 2 and rule 3 did not apply, so rust had no way of knowing the outputs lifetime
    // so, we had to manually apply the lifetime and tell rust that hey, all of these params
    // are of lifetime 'a, and that the output was also of lifetime 'a
    // rust will not assume the lifetime of the output if it cannot do so using the rules above

    // lets use lifetimes in method definitions
    impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
        // the lifetime to self is not required becuase of rule 3 of the lifetime elision rules
        fn level(&self) -> i32 {
            3
        }
        // here is an example of where we can omit the lifetime of the return value because of rule 3
        fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
            println!("attention please: {}", announcement);
            self.part
        }
    }

    // lets discuss static lifetimes
    // static lifetimes are stored directly in a programs binary and are always availble
    let static_string: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime";
    println!("{static_string}");
